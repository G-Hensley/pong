# 🏓 PONG: The Ultimate Table Tennis Showdown! 🏓

## What's This?

Remember the 70s? Neither do I! But this classic arcade game sure brings back those retro vibes! PONG is the OG video game that started it all - a simple yet addictive virtual table tennis game where two players battle it out with digital paddles.

## 🚀 Features

- Smooth paddle controls that respond to your every command
- A ball that gets faster and FASTER with each hit! Can you keep up?
- Dazzling scoreboard that tracks your epic victories
- First to 5 points wins and gets to do a victory dance (dance not included in software)
- Retro black background with classic white elements - we're keeping it old school!

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Make sure you have Python and the Turtle module installed
3. Run `python main.py` to start the game
4. Grab a friend (or foe) to play against - or control both paddles yourself if you're feeling particularly ambidextrous!

## 🕹️ Controls

- **Left Paddle**:
  - `W` key to move UP
  - `S` key to move DOWN
- **Right Paddle**:
  - `↑` (Up Arrow) to move UP
  - `↓` (Down Arrow) to move DOWN

## 💻 Technical Magic

This game is built using Python's Turtle graphics library, which is perfect for creating simple games while learning programming concepts like:

- Object-oriented programming
- Game loops
- Collision detection
- Event handling
- Score tracking

## 🏆 Winning Strategy

The key to winning is... well, not missing the ball! Keep your paddle in line with the ball's trajectory and try to anticipate your opponent's moves. The ball speeds up after each hit, so stay on your toes!

## 🎯 Challenge Ideas

- Try playing with one hand behind your back
- Set up a tournament with friends
- See if you can reach a rally of 50 hits without scoring

## 🧙‍♂️ Developer Notes

May cause extreme competitiveness and occasional trash talk between friends.
